# ☕ NoSQL Coffee Reference Analysis (MongoDB + NoSQL Booster)

## 📌 Overview  
This project explores coffee reference data using NoSQL techniques in MongoDB. Developed for the AN6004 Individual Assignment, it demonstrates how document-based databases can be used to model, query, and analyze semi-structured data. The dataset includes coffee origin, roast level, flavor notes, and brewing methods—structured to support flexible querying and business insight generation.

## 🎯 Purpose  
To apply NoSQL concepts in a real-world context by importing, modeling, and analyzing coffee reference data using MongoDB. The project highlights schema flexibility, aggregation pipelines, and query logic tailored for operational analytics and strategic decision-making.

## 🗃️ Files Included  
- `AN6004_IA.zip` — Contains the coffee reference dataset for MongoDB import  
- `Khue_NoSQL_coffee reference.js` — JavaScript file with MongoDB queries, designed to run in NoSQL Booster

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- MongoDB (database storage)  
- NoSQL Booster (query execution environment)  
- Aggregation Framework

## 📈 Key Features  
- Imports and structures coffee reference data into MongoDB collections  
- Applies filtering, projection, and aggregation to explore roast levels, flavor profiles, and brewing methods  
- Demonstrates flexible schema design and nested document handling  
- Uses `$match`, `$group`, `$project`, and `$sort` to extract meaningful insights  
- Reflects real-world use of NoSQL for operational and strategic analysis

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Unzip `AN6004_IA.zip` and import the dataset into MongoDB  
2. Open `Khue_NoSQL_coffee reference.js` in **NoSQL Booster**  
3. Run the queries to explore and analyze the data  
4. Modify or extend the logic to suit additional business questions
